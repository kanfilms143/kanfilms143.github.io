<p> Story By a Rickshaw Puller - A pulled rickshaw  is a mode of human-powered transport by which a runner draws a two-wheeled cart which seats one or two people.

In recent times the use of human-powered rickshaws has been discouraged or outlawed in many countries due to concern for the welfare of rickshaw workers.[1] Pulled rickshaws have been replaced mainly by cycle rickshaw and auto rickshaws.
Every life has a story. No matter who the person may be, everyone has a story to be told.

People are used to listening to success stories, tales of heroes and heroics. Ruhul Amin is no hero. He is just one of the million and a half rickshaw pullers in the Dhaka city, a face in innumerable faces that dot the landscape. But, he has also a story to share. It is a story that has been completely untold.

Ruhul kicks off his day around noon like his other fellow rickshaw pullers and plies the streets till 10:00 at night. He maintains this routine six days a week, rain or shine.

This 36-year-old rickshaw puller elaborates his daily routine to this reporter on Monday on his way to Dhaka University from Karwan Bazar.

In his 19 years of rickshaw-pulling, Ruhul Amin has witnessed every up and down of this city. Everything has changed in front of him, but it brings no changes to his life. Rickshaw puller Ruhul remains a rickshaw puller for the last two decades.

As he was born in a destitute family, life was never a comfort for him. </p>
